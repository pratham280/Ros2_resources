# ROS Resources — Introduction & Project Map

This repository collects notes, installation scripts, and resources for working with ROS (Robot Operating System) and ROS2. It's organized to help you quickly find installation instructions, simulation guides, and SLAM resources.

What this repo contains
- `Installation/` — installation guides and scripts for ROS1 and ROS2 (platform- and distribution-specific).
- `ROS Installation/Install scripts/` — install scripts to automate setup (review before running).
- `Issac Sim/` — notes and resources for NVIDIA Isaac Sim integration and examples.
- `SLAM/` — SLAM-related resources, tutorials, and datasets.

Quick introduction to ROS and ROS2
- ROS (ROS1) is a framework providing libraries and tools to help build robot applications. Typical components: nodes, topics, services, actions, messages, and parameter server.
- ROS2 is the successor to ROS1 with improved real-time support, DDS-based communication, multi-platform support, and better security. Distributions are named (e.g., Kinetic, Melodic, Noetic for ROS1; Foxy, Humble, Rolling for ROS2).

Quick start
1. Read `Installation/README.md` for distribution-specific install steps.
2. Use the install scripts in `ROS Installation/Install scripts/` if you prefer automated setup.
3. For simulation and perception workflows, check `Issac Sim/README.md`.
4. For SLAM tutorials, datasets, and notes, open `SLAM/SLAMResources.md`.

Repository layout (high level)

- `Installation/` — platform & distro guides. Main entry: `Installation/README.md`.
- `ROS Installation/Install scripts/` — automated install scripts. Review before running.
- `Issac Sim/` — NVIDIA Isaac Sim notes and examples.
- `SLAM/` — SLAM resources, algorithms, and datasets.
- `README.md` — this file.

Contributing
- Please open issues or pull requests if you want to add distributions, scripts, or improve documentation.

More resources
- Official ROS1 docs: https://wiki.ros.org
- Official ROS2 docs: https://docs.ros.org

If you'd like, I can:
- expand `Installation/README.md` with distro tables and commands per distribution,
- add safety checks and dry-run flags to `ROS Installation/Install scripts/`,
- create a minimal demo workspace and a short tutorial to validate installations.

Which of these would you like me to do next?
